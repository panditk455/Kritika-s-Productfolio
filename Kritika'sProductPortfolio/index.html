    <h1>CampusConnect: Bridging Food Access Gaps for International Students</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="detail-content">
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        CampusConnect is a mobile app prototype I helped build to address a challenge very close to my heart,food insecurity among international students. Many face not only financial hardships but also transportation and cultural barriers that make it hard to access nutritious food.
        Drawing from my own experiences as an international student, I worked with my team to design a system that connects students to surplus food, rideshares, and community resources, aiming to restore dignity and build supportive networks on campus.
      </p>

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>Ongoing(April ‚Äì June 2025)</p>

      <h3>Team</h3>
      <p>Kritika, Cuong, Daniel</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Problem Discovery & User Research</h2>
      <h3>Research Methodology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted interviews with 15 international students across 3 campuses</li>
        <li>Distributed surveys to 120+ students dealing with food access challenges</li>
        <li>Observed dining hall operations and spoke with campus staff</li>
        <li>Engaged with stakeholders from dining, transportation, and international offices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of transportation to grocery stores or pantries</li>
        <li>Financial barriers due to currency gaps and work restrictions</li>
        <li>Cultural disconnect when finding familiar, affordable food</li>
        <li>Underused food resources and lack of awareness</li>
        <li>Isolation and lack of peer support networks</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="user-quotes-box">
        <h3>What Users Said</h3>
        <blockquote>‚ÄúI skip meals sometimes because I don‚Äôt have money or a car, and I see so much food wasted in the dining hall. I wish there was a better way to access food that fits my culture and dietary needs.‚Äù</blockquote>
        <blockquote>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt work off-campus, so my budget is really tight. Some weeks, I survive on instant noodles just to make rent.‚Äù </blockquote>
        <blockquote>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know the campus had a food pantry until my third year. These resources exist, but no one talks about them.‚Äù </blockquote>
        <blockquote>‚ÄúI often feel embarrassed asking for help. It would be nice to have something that doesn‚Äôt make me feel like a burden.‚Äù</blockquote>
        <blockquote>‚ÄúSometimes I just want to cook something from home, but the ingredients are hard to find or super expensive.‚Äù </blockquote>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Problem Statement & Opportunity</h2>
      <p>
        International students face food insecurity driven by financial, logistical, and cultural barriers, despite campuses generating tons of edible food waste and offering underpublicized resources.
      </p>

      <h3>Opportunity Space</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make surplus food more accessible</li>
        <li>Reduce food waste through redistribution</li>
        <li>Enable shared transportation to grocery stores</li>
        <li>Foster community through peer-based food sharing</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Design Process</h2>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Design Thinking with student-centered empathy</li>
        <li>Agile UX with weekly user testing and iteration</li>
        <li>Accessibility-first for ESL and low-digital-literacy users</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        We started with a hand-drawn paper prototype to explore ideas quickly and validate basic layouts. Students provided feedback on navigation clarity and feature relevance before we moved to digital tools.
      </p>
      <img src="images/casestudy4/paperprototype.png" alt="Paper Prototype" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 10px;">

      <h4>User Feedback Highlights (Paper)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>‚ÄúI like seeing everything on one dashboard, it makes things feel organized.‚Äù</li>
        <li>‚ÄúThis feels like something I‚Äôd use when I‚Äôm stressed and need quick help.‚Äù</li>
        <li>‚ÄúCan this include food from my culture? That would be amazing.‚Äù</li>
        <li>‚ÄúEmergency food help should be easier to spot.‚Äù</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        We created black-and-white Figma wireframes focused on usability. These low-fidelity designs helped us test navigation flows and screen structure without visual distractions.
      </p>

      <h3>Mid/High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        For the next iteration, we introduced visual hierarchy, icons, and culturally inclusive design. We chose green as our primary color because it evokes calm, wellness, and sustainability, matching the values of dignity and nourishment we want this app to promote.
      </p>

        <h1>Carls Swap: Carleton Student Exchange Platform</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="detail-content">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Carls Swap is a project aimed at creating an efficient system for Carleton students to exchange items both during the school year and the end-of-year cleanup. Our platform provides an interface for students to offer extra items they no longer need while streamlining the process for the Center for Community and Civic Engagement (CCCE) to manage, reserve, and sell items collected during cleanup. Students can also reserve high-value items, ensuring they remain within the Carleton community.</p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>As a UX/UI Designer and Research Lead, I led user research, designed prototypes, coordinated usability testing, and implemented feedback into final design iterations.</p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <p>3 months (March 2024 - June 2024)</p>

            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>Kritika Pandit, Owen Xu, Lucky Beulla Muhoza, Daniel Scheider</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce item waste on campus</li>
                <li>Improve student accessibility to shared resources</li>
                <li>Support CCCE operations and planning</li>
                <li>Create a clean, mobile-friendly user experience</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Each year, hundreds of items are left behind or thrown away during move-outs. CCCE staff struggle with managing inventory, and students lack a structured, campus-specific platform for trading usable items. This leads to environmental harm and loss of valuable resources. CCCE‚Äôs resale efforts are limited without a tech-enabled system, and students often resort to off-campus platforms.</p>

      <h1>Carls Chat: Real-Time Campus Communication Platform</h1>
    </div>
  
    <div class="detail-content">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Carls Chat began with an idea I pitched during our brainstorming phase: a live chat website tailored for Carleton students. Inspired by the gaps in communication across campus, especially between departments and clubs, we designed a platform where users could communicate in real-time across private rooms, public channels, and interest-based groups. We intentionally veered from common game projects to pursue a functional communication system built entirely from scratch.</p>
  
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>2 months (Fall 2024)</p>
  
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I led the frontend development and UI/UX design, pitched the original concept, and worked on the backend WebSocket logic, Firebase data routing, and presence management. I ensured visual design and backend functionality were integrated seamlessly across the tech stack.</p>
  
        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend: React.js, Material UI, Adobe Fresco (hand-drawn elements)</li>
          <li>Backend: Node.js, WebSockets</li>
          <li>Database: Firebase Realtime Database</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We chose to doodle all graphics, including buttons, avatars, maps, and food items, by hand in Adobe Fresco to give the platform a playful, student-centric identity. This added significant time to the project, especially when iterating on color themes. We started with a black-and-white aesthetic, which later evolved into a colorful palette after receiving usability feedback.
            I specifically drew the maps, food icons, and avatars for the Sayles Hill Campus Center page. Balancing visual design and functional UI involved repeated iterations with feedback from users both within and outside our class.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Development & Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Our group, Daniel, Daniel, Alex, Palmy, and I, split into front-end and back-end subteams. Initially, I worked solo on the UI, then collaborated with Palmy on the Sayles page. I also contributed to backend development, setting up WebSocket events, presence status logic, and Firebase message storage integration. Syncing both ends meant debugging database sync issues and writing socket events that wouldn‚Äôt overload our lightweight Firebase backend.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Real-time messaging:</strong> Enabled via WebSockets with typing indicators</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple chat rooms:</strong> Based on academic departments and student groups</li>
          <li><strong>User presence indicators:</strong> Displayed online status with real-time updates</li>
          <li><strong>Live avatars and animations:</strong> Hand-drawn for authenticity</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile responsiveness:</strong> Clean layout for all devices</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Challenges & Design Decisions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining consistency in hand-drawn assets across pages</li>
          <li>Choosing and updating color themes late in the project lifecycle</li>
          <li>Omitting the Weitz Center from the map due to layout constraints</li>
          <li>Avoiding third-party images in favor of self-created designs</li>
          <li>Debugging backend crashes when frontend WebSocket code broke message routing</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>One particularly tough moment was deciding whether to abandon the hand-drawn look in favor of faster solutions. But staying true to our aesthetic vision paid off, users appreciated the charm and cohesion it added.</p>

        <p>Carls Chat stood out among our peers' projects due to its real-world utility and original aesthetic. It brought together technical functionality and emotional design in a way that felt truly personal and useful.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project taught me that leadership involves both vision and vulnerability. Pitching an unconventional idea, supporting my team through uncertainty, and sticking with creative decisions all required courage. I‚Äôm proud that I led us through that process with empathy and persistence.
            As a full-stack contributor, I learned how frontend decisions ripple into backend constraints, and vice versa. From debugging WebSocket crashes to pairing on CSS redesigns, I gained technical fluency and team empathy. I now better understand the importance of co-designing features, not just screens, with engineers, designers, and users alike.
            Most importantly, I‚Äôm thankful for the collaboration with Daniel, Daniel, Alex, and Palmy. From solving backend bugs to debugging CSS side-by-side, our team showed what it means to build not just software, but trust. Carls Chat isn‚Äôt just a product, it‚Äôs a story of creative risk, team resilience, and human-centered design.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Travel journaling is scattered.

        <h1>Ethnicity, Nature, and Urban Life in Singapore</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="detail-content">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Our interdisciplinary project explores how Singapore weaves together culture, community, and nature through thoughtful urban planning. As three women of Nepali, Thai, and Malaysian Chinese heritage, we see reflections of our own homes in Singapore‚Äôs neighborhoods, Little India, Kampong Glam, and Chinatown. Our goal is to learn how inclusive urban planning can honor cultural diversity while promoting environmental sustainability.</p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>As part of a collaborative trio, I (Kritika) will focus on documenting Indian heritage sites and cultural-ecological intersections in Little India, and co-designing a prototype for Kathmandu that blends Hindu spirituality with green urban infrastructure.</p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <p>Planning Phase: Summer - Fall 2025<br>Field Research in Singapore: Nov 25 - Dec 12, 2025<br>Final Deliverables: Winter 2026</p>

            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>Kritika Pandit (Nepal), Palmy (Thailand), Rachel (Malaysia)</p>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>We have recently received a fellowship from Carleton College to pursue this project. Field research will take place over 17 days during our winter break, where we will observe, interview, and explore key neighborhoods and planning initiatives in Singapore. Our work builds on shared experiences growing up in Southeast and South Asia and reflects a desire to adapt Singapore‚Äôs ideas to our respective cities.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand how Singapore‚Äôs ethnic diversity shapes its urban planning</li>
                <li>Explore how nature and culture co-exist in public spaces</li>
                <li>Document inclusive, sustainable design practices</li>
                <li>Design speculative urban prototypes for Nepal, Thailand, and Malaysia</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Many cities in South and Southeast Asia struggle to balance rapid urbanization with cultural preservation and environmental sustainability. Our home cities, Kathmandu, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur, face challenges ranging from air pollution to cultural displacement. Singapore offers a rare case study where multicultural heritage and ecological planning are visibly integrated into urban life.</p>

            <h3>Why it Matters</h3>
            <p>We believe learning from Singapore can help us reimagine what urban development could look like in our home countries‚Äînot just functional, but culturally rich and ecologically sound. This matters deeply as we look for alternatives to extractive models of development.</p>

    <h1>AI Puzzle Game: Designing Playful Learning Tools for AI Literacy</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="detail-content">

<div class="section">
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>This ongoing UI/UX project focuses on designing AI-based puzzle games that help students across disciplines understand and experiment with generative AI tools like ChatGPT. The games aim to make AI learning more accessible, meaningful, and fun.</p>

  <h3>Role</h3>
  <p>UX Designer & Researcher</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p>OnGoing</p>

  <h3>Objectives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design inclusive AI puzzles tailored to student needs</li>
    <li>Publish a playable prototype by July</li>
    <li>Develop a framework for scalable puzzle creation</li>
    <li>Promote AI literacy through engaging, low-barrier formats</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Problem Space</h2>
  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p>Most students are curious about AI but don‚Äôt engage deeply due to a lack of playful, discipline-specific entry points. There are limited tools that teach AI usage in an interactive and inclusive format.</p>

  <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
  <p>We believe that playful learning lowers intimidation and encourages experimentation with AI, building critical AI literacy that is applicable across fields.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Phase 1: Stakeholder Engagement & Participatory Design</h2>
  <h3>Stakeholders: Who & Why</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Students from diverse majors (main user base)</li>
    <li>Faculty exploring AI or digital pedagogy</li>
    <li>Learning support staff</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Students gain low-barrier exposure to AI through fun puzzles. Faculty can use the puzzles in class. Staff benefit from fresh learning resources.</p>

  <h3>Motivation & Origin</h3>
  <p>The idea originated from interest in AI, game-based learning, and inclusive design. A conversation around Carleton‚Äôs Amplify AI platform sparked the idea of guided puzzles for fun, contextual learning.</p>

  <h3>Stakeholder Recruitment Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Targeted summer students from various majors</li>
    <li>Criteria: academic diversity, AI experience levels, and willingness to co-create</li>
    <li>Methods: in-person requests, emails, peer outreach, casual invites</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Research Phase</h2>
  <h3>Methodology: Semi-Structured Interviews</h3>
  <p>We conducted a series of semi-structured interviews to understand what makes AI puzzle games meaningful, fun, and educational.</p>

  <h4>Sample Interview Questions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>"Tell me about a time you used ChatGPT or another AI tool for a class."</li>
    <li>"What kind of AI puzzle formats would be fun but not frustrating?"</li>
    <li>"What would make a puzzle feel relevant to your major?"</li>
    <li>"How would you know if a puzzle helped you understand AI better?"</li>
    <li>"What features would make you recommend a puzzle to others?"</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Participatory Design</h3>
  <p>We invited students into the design process through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Focus groups and playtesting of draft puzzles</li>
    <li>Fictional inquiry (e.g., "Imagine a biology major using AI in a puzzle‚Ä¶")</li>
    <li>Figma and paper prototyping</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Post-Interview Analysis</h3>
  <p>We transcribed and coded responses using Otter.ai and axial coding to find patterns across disciplines. This helped prioritize features that appeared repeatedly in interviews.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Insights from Interviews</h2>
