        <h1>Carls Swap: Carleton Student Exchange Platform</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="detail-content">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Carls Swap is a project aimed at creating an efficient system for Carleton students to exchange items both during the school year and the end-of-year cleanup. Our platform provides an interface for students to offer extra items they no longer need while streamlining the process for the Center for Community and Civic Engagement (CCCE) to manage, reserve, and sell items collected during cleanup. Students can also reserve high-value items, ensuring they remain within the Carleton community.</p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>As a UX/UI Designer and Research Lead, I led user research, designed prototypes, coordinated usability testing, and implemented feedback into final design iterations.</p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <p>3 months (March 2024 - June 2024)</p>

            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>Kritika Pandit, Owen Xu, Lucky Beulla Muhoza, Daniel Scheider</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce item waste on campus</li>
                <li>Improve student accessibility to shared resources</li>
                <li>Support CCCE operations and planning</li>
                <li>Create a clean, mobile-friendly user experience</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Each year, hundreds of items are left behind or thrown away during move-outs. CCCE staff struggle with managing inventory, and students lack a structured, campus-specific platform for trading usable items. This leads to environmental harm and loss of valuable resources. CCCE‚Äôs resale efforts are limited without a tech-enabled system, and students often resort to off-campus platforms.</p>

                <li>Users prefer an app and mobile-first access</li>
                <li>Buying/selling options and Venmo links are essential</li>
                <li>Filters, categories, and item reservations are priorities</li>
                <li>Wishlist, messaging, and privacy are highly valued</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>

            <h3>Phase I: Ideation & Sketching</h3>
            <p>After conducting fictional inquiry interviews, participants sketched their ideal platforms. I developed early prototypes and a logo to foster community identity. Users requested Venmo links, filters, and a reservation cart. I used generative sketching and brainstorming on iPad.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <p><strong>Paper Prototype from Fictional Inquiry:</strong></p>

            </div>

            <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
            <p>Built in Figma, this prototype included wishlist, Venmo, clean UI, and intuitive actions.</p>

            <img src="images/FigmaPrototype.png" alt="Low Fidelity Figma Prototype for Carls Swap" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />

            <h3>Phase II: Iteration & Mid-Fidelity Design</h3>
            <p>We interviewed 6 stakeholders, including CCCE staff and students. We performed axial coding and created themes to drive development. Classmates tested the prototype, offering iterative feedback. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qsFGXSH3qS2pkdfWHvwmJxupHlvxalU-qZoZi46DIuM/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">View axial coding sheet</a>.</p>

            <h2>Testing & Iteration</h2>

            <h3>Phase III: UX Evaluation</h3>
            <p>I conducted a 39-minute sticky note evaluation with 2 users. Tasks included finding, saving, selling items, and navigating settings.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="images/Affinity_Diagram.jpg" alt="Affinity Diagram from UX Research" style="width: 90%; height: auto;" />
            </div>

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Add visible chat button</li>
                <li>Enable opt-in notifications</li>
                <li>Integrate Venmo for transaction tracking</li>
                <li>Add dark mode and "Forgot Password" feature</li>
                <li>Limit CCCE access to private user data</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Main Requirements (from Axial Coding)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Exchanging items without storage using messaging</li>
                <li>Wishlist + notifications to avoid repeated searching</li>
                <li>CCCE inventory tracking to prioritize New Student Week items</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>How the prototype fulfills requirements:</h4>
            <p>It allows students to coordinate exchanges via messaging, use a wishlist with notifications, and auto-relist unpurchased items. CCCE can track items through a sales dashboard.</p>

        <h1>CampusConnect: Bridging Food Access Gaps for International Students</h1>
   </div>

    <div class="detail-content">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>CampusConnect is a mobile application prototype designed to support international students experiencing food insecurity due to transportation, financial, and cultural barriers. Through design thinking and user-centered research, we created a system that streamlines access to surplus food, shared rides, and community resources. Our prototype aims to empower universities to reduce waste, support student well-being, and build stronger cultural communities.</p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <p>1.5 months (April ‚Äì June 2025)</p>

            <h3>Team</h3>

            <h2>Problem Discovery & User Research</h2>
            <h3>Research Methodology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Semi-structured interviews with 15 international students across 3 campuses</li>
                <li>Surveys distributed to 120+ students facing food access challenges</li>
                <li>Observational studies of dining hall operations and food waste</li>
                <li>Stakeholder interviews with campus dining services, transportation offices, and international student advisors</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>73% of students lacked reliable transportation to ethnic grocery stores or food pantries</li>
                <li>Currency conversion and visa-related work restrictions heightened financial hardship</li>
                <li>Students faced cultural barriers accessing familiar foods</li>
                <li>Existing resources like food pantries were poorly publicized or underutilized</li>
                <li>Many felt isolated and unaware of student-to-student support opportunities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Critical User Insight</h3>
            <blockquote>‚ÄúI skip meals sometimes because I don‚Äôt have money or a car, and I see so much food wasted in the dining hall. I wish there was a better way to access food that fits my culture and dietary needs.‚Äù - International Student from Nepal</blockquote>

      <h1>Carls Chat: Real-Time Campus Communication Platform</h1>
    </div>
  
    <div class="detail-content">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Carls Chat began with an idea I pitched during our brainstorming phase: a live chat website tailored for Carleton students. Inspired by the gaps in communication across campus, especially between departments and clubs, we designed a platform where users could communicate in real-time across private rooms, public channels, and interest-based groups. We intentionally veered from common game projects to pursue a functional communication system built entirely from scratch.</p>
  
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>2 months (Fall 2024)</p>
  
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I led the frontend development and UI/UX design, pitched the original concept, and worked on the backend WebSocket logic, Firebase data routing, and presence management. I ensured visual design and backend functionality were integrated seamlessly across the tech stack.</p>
  
        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend: React.js, Material UI, Adobe Fresco (hand-drawn elements)</li>
          <li>Backend: Node.js, WebSockets</li>
          <li>Database: Firebase Realtime Database</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We chose to doodle all graphics, including buttons, avatars, maps, and food items, by hand in Adobe Fresco to give the platform a playful, student-centric identity. This added significant time to the project, especially when iterating on color themes. We started with a black-and-white aesthetic, which later evolved into a colorful palette after receiving usability feedback.
            I specifically drew the maps, food icons, and avatars for the Sayles Hill Campus Center page. Balancing visual design and functional UI involved repeated iterations with feedback from users both within and outside our class.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Development & Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Our group, Daniel, Daniel, Alex, Palmy, and I, split into front-end and back-end subteams. Initially, I worked solo on the UI, then collaborated with Palmy on the Sayles page. I also contributed to backend development, setting up WebSocket events, presence status logic, and Firebase message storage integration. Syncing both ends meant debugging database sync issues and writing socket events that wouldn‚Äôt overload our lightweight Firebase backend.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Real-time messaging:</strong> Enabled via WebSockets with typing indicators</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple chat rooms:</strong> Based on academic departments and student groups</li>
          <li><strong>User presence indicators:</strong> Displayed online status with real-time updates</li>
          <li><strong>Live avatars and animations:</strong> Hand-drawn for authenticity</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile responsiveness:</strong> Clean layout for all devices</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Challenges & Design Decisions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining consistency in hand-drawn assets across pages</li>
          <li>Choosing and updating color themes late in the project lifecycle</li>
          <li>Omitting the Weitz Center from the map due to layout constraints</li>
          <li>Avoiding third-party images in favor of self-created designs</li>
          <li>Debugging backend crashes when frontend WebSocket code broke message routing</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>One particularly tough moment was deciding whether to abandon the hand-drawn look in favor of faster solutions. But staying true to our aesthetic vision paid off, users appreciated the charm and cohesion it added.</p>

        <p>Carls Chat stood out among our peers' projects due to its real-world utility and original aesthetic. It brought together technical functionality and emotional design in a way that felt truly personal and useful.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project taught me that leadership involves both vision and vulnerability. Pitching an unconventional idea, supporting my team through uncertainty, and sticking with creative decisions all required courage. I‚Äôm proud that I led us through that process with empathy and persistence.
            As a full-stack contributor, I learned how frontend decisions ripple into backend constraints, and vice versa. From debugging WebSocket crashes to pairing on CSS redesigns, I gained technical fluency and team empathy. I now better understand the importance of co-designing features, not just screens, with engineers, designers, and users alike.
            Most importantly, I‚Äôm thankful for the collaboration with Daniel, Daniel, Alex, and Palmy. From solving backend bugs to debugging CSS side-by-side, our team showed what it means to build not just software, but trust. Carls Chat isn‚Äôt just a product, it‚Äôs a story of creative risk, team resilience, and human-centered design.</p>

                <h2>Why WanderLog?</h2>
                <p>
                    During our study abroad semester, my teammate and I found ourselves constantly switching between Google Sheets, gallery apps, maps, and notebooks to keep track of where we had been, how much we had spent, and what we experienced each day. We realized there wasn‚Äôt a single platform that allowed us to *document, plan, and visualize* our journeys in one cohesive space. That frustration became our inspiration. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>WanderLog</strong> was born from our desire to streamline travel journaling, an Android app that not only captures memories but also makes them easy to revisit, reflect on, and share.

        <h1>Ethnicity, Nature, and Urban Life in Singapore</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="detail-content">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Our interdisciplinary project explores how Singapore weaves together culture, community, and nature through thoughtful urban planning. As three women of Nepali, Thai, and Malaysian Chinese heritage, we see reflections of our own homes in Singapore‚Äôs neighborhoods, Little India, Kampong Glam, and Chinatown. Our goal is to learn how inclusive urban planning can honor cultural diversity while promoting environmental sustainability.</p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>As part of a collaborative trio, I (Kritika) will focus on documenting Indian heritage sites and cultural-ecological intersections in Little India, and co-designing a prototype for Kathmandu that blends Hindu spirituality with green urban infrastructure.</p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <p>Planning Phase: Summer - Fall 2025<br>Field Research in Singapore: Nov 25 - Dec 12, 2025<br>Final Deliverables: Winter 2026</p>

            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>Kritika Pandit (Nepal), Palmy (Thailand), Rachel (Malaysia)</p>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>We have recently received a fellowship from Carleton College to pursue this project. Field research will take place over 17 days during our winter break, where we will observe, interview, and explore key neighborhoods and planning initiatives in Singapore. Our work builds on shared experiences growing up in Southeast and South Asia and reflects a desire to adapt Singapore‚Äôs ideas to our respective cities.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand how Singapore‚Äôs ethnic diversity shapes its urban planning</li>
                <li>Explore how nature and culture co-exist in public spaces</li>
                <li>Document inclusive, sustainable design practices</li>
                <li>Design speculative urban prototypes for Nepal, Thailand, and Malaysia</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Many cities in South and Southeast Asia struggle to balance rapid urbanization with cultural preservation and environmental sustainability. Our home cities, Kathmandu, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur, face challenges ranging from air pollution to cultural displacement. Singapore offers a rare case study where multicultural heritage and ecological planning are visibly integrated into urban life.</p>

            <h3>Why it Matters</h3>
            <p>We believe learning from Singapore can help us reimagine what urban development could look like in our home countries‚Äînot just functional, but culturally rich and ecologically sound. This matters deeply as we look for alternatives to extractive models of development.</p>
